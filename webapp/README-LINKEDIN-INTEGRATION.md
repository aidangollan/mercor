# LinkedIn Integration

This document explains the implementation of LinkedIn connection retrieval directly in the web app, eliminating the need for a Chrome extension.

## Overview

The application now provides a direct method for uploading LinkedIn connections through the web app interface. Users can enter their LinkedIn credentials, and the application will automatically retrieve and process their connections.

## Implementation Details

### Components

1. **LinkedIn Page (`/linkedin`)**
   - Provides a form for users to enter their LinkedIn credentials
   - Handles the connection retrieval and processing workflow
   - Shows real-time status updates during the process

2. **LinkedIn API Endpoint (`/api/linkedin/connections`)**
   - Uses Puppeteer to automate the LinkedIn login and connection extraction process
   - Securely handles user credentials (not stored, only used for authentication)
   - Returns a list of LinkedIn connection usernames

### Security Considerations

- User credentials are only used for authentication and are not stored
- The connection between the web app and LinkedIn is secured
- Puppeteer runs in headless mode to prevent visual exposure of the automation process

### Dependencies

- Added `puppeteer` for browser automation

## Usage

1. Navigate to the LinkedIn page in the web app
2. Enter your LinkedIn credentials
3. Submit the form to retrieve and process your connections
4. View the results in the Graph visualization

## Future Improvements

- Implement OAuth 2.0 with LinkedIn API for a more secure authentication flow
- Add rate limiting and caching to prevent excessive requests
- Improve error handling and user feedback during the connection retrieval process
